# puttingTheDataInDA
Some scripts for interpreting data and observation files for the purposes of feeding experimental data into our cardiacDA project.
The scripts expect `./2011-05-28_Rec78-103_Pace_Apex/` to exist and `./obs/` to exist.
To use, `clone` the repository and then, from the Julia prompt `julia > ] instantiate`.
